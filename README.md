# 🔍 Forensic Analyzer (Work in Progress)

It is a simple **browser-based forensic tool** made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Right now, the project is still under development, and I will keep adding more features as I learn.

---

## 📌 Current Features 

✔ Hash Generator (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)  
✔ Base64 Encode / Decode  
✔ Many additional encryption and decryption tools will be included in the future. 

These tools are basic but useful for learning digital forensics and simple analysis tasks.

---

## 🚧 Upcoming Features (Planned)

- EXIF metadata viewer  
- File upload → hash generator  
- Better UI design  
- More forensic tools    
The following features are planned and will be added as the project evolves.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

- The system shall provide a web-based interface to access multiple cybersecurity and forensic tools.
- The system shall allow users to select tools option-wise .
- The system shall support Caesar Cipher operations, including:
  * Encryption
  * Decryption
  * Automatic key detection (auto-decrypt)
- The system shall generate strong random passwords based on user-defined length.
- The system shall accept user input through web forms and process it using backend logic.
- The system shall execute Python-based tools on the backend and return results to the frontend.
- The system shall display tool output clearly on the same webpage without page reload.
- The system shall allow integration of external online tools via links or embedded views.
- The system shall be modular, allowing new tools to be added without redesigning the entire system.
- The system shall generate structured outputs in readable format for user analysis.

---

## ✅ Non-Functional Requirements

- The system shall be platform-independent and accessible through any modern web browser.
- The system shall provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface suitable for beginners.
- The system shall ensure fast response time for tool execution and result display.
- The system shall be secure, allowing execution of only predefined backend tools.
- The system shall validate user input to prevent invalid or malicious data submission.
- The system shall be scalable, supporting future addition of forensic and security tools.
- The system shall maintain high availability for frontend access through static web hosting.
- The system shall ensure reliability, producing consistent results for repeated executions.
- The system shall be maintainable, with clean separation between frontend and backend code.
- The system shall follow standard coding practices for readability and ease of debugging.
